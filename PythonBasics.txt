<!-- Syntax, Terms etc --> 

1. Expression:  An expression evaluates to a specific value

2. Statement: A statement represents a concrete action of some kind 

3. Function: A function in Python takes an input and returns an output 
 
4. Mathematical Operators: +, -, *, /, Exponent: **, ()  ---> Python uses the Order of Operations rules

5. Variable declaration: no keyword needed; only use variable name (i.e. fashion_designer = "Zac Posen") 

6. Lists: Arrays are called "Lists" in Python 

7. List Comprehension: Place the operation first, followed by for loop syntax 
   Ex: fashion_designer = [(dress_size * 2) for dress in dresses]
       This code will double each dress size in the "dresses" list and store in the variable "fashion designer"
